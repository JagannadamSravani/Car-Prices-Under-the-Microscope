## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

Using **pandas** for data handling and **seaborn/matplotlib** for visualization, this project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the car dataset. Various plots are generated to reveal how features such as:

- **Fuel Type**
- **Aspiration**
- **Number of Doors**
- **Car Body**
- **Drive Wheel Configuration**
- **Engine Location**
- **Engine Type**
- **Cylinder Number**
- **Fuel System**

impact the car prices.

The analysis also includes data preprocessing steps like label encoding and feature correlation analysis, laying a foundation for future predictive modeling.
